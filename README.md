# PGTA_aneuploidy
This repository contains the code and description for the paper "Identifying genes associated with the risk of maternal aneuploidy using PGT-A ultra-low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data". The aim of the paper is to introduce a generalizable method that can be leveraged for association studies using ultra-low-coverage whole-genome sequencing data (~.01x) with an example in identifying biomarkers related to infertility.
